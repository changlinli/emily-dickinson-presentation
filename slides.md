% Emily Dickinson: Slant Rhyme and Sound Change
% Changlin Li (mail@changlinli.com)

## What this talk is about

+ Emily Dickinson
+ Her slant rhyme
+ The need to take sound change into account when discussing sounds!

## Emily Dickinson

+ 1830 - 1886
+ Born and died in Amherst, MA
+ Wrote many poems

## There is no frigate like a book (1286)

There is no Frigate like a Book\
To take us Lands **away**,\
Nor any Coursers like a Page\
Of prancing **Poetry** –\
This Traverse may the poorest take\
Without oppress of Toll –\
How frugal is the Chariot\
That bears a Human soul.\

## Because I could not stop for Death (712)

...\
We slowly drove — He knew no haste\
And I had put **away**\
My labor and my leisure too,\
For His **Civility** —\
...\
Since then – 'tis Centuries – and yet\
Feels shorter than the **Day**\
I first surmised the Horses' Heads\
Were toward **Eternity** –\

## I heard a fly buzz (591)

...\
 I willed my Keepsakes - Signed away\
What portion of me **be**\
Assignable - and then it was\
There interposed a **Fly** -\
...\

## What Do People Say (There is no frigate like a book)

"'away' and 'Poetry' – we have what's called a slant or sight rhyme... So,
those of us who were embarrassedly trying to make "Poetry" sounds like "away"
("Um, Po-e-tray?") can breathe a sigh of relief... it's one of Dickinson's
trademarks" ([https://www.shmoop.com/there-is-no-frigate-like-a-book/rhyme-form-meter.html](https://www.shmoop.com/there-is-no-frigate-like-a-book/rhyme-form-meter.html))

## What Do People Say (There is no frigate like a book)

"The shorter lines here rhyme - or, in the case of "away/Poetry", employ slant
rhyme. Dickinson was a pioneer when it came to the use of slant rhyme..."
(https://kellyrfineman.livejournal.com/560001.html)

## What Do People Say (Because I could not stop for Death)

"The rhyme isn't regular (meaning it doesn't follow a particular pattern) but
there is rhyme in this poem. 'Me' rhymes with 'Immortality' and, farther down
the poem, with 'Civility' and, finally, 'Eternity.' "

## What Do People Say (Because I could not stop for Death)

"The rhyme scheme is abcb, each second line being full or slant with the fourth
line: me/immortality away/civility ground/ground day/eternity"

## Central thesis

Wait, what if that's actually the way Dickinson talked?

## Background plausibility

+ Dickinson was born 47 years after the American Revolution
+ Amherst, MA (New England accent different even today)
+ Early sound recordings sound different

## Calvin Coolidge speaking

[https://www.loc.gov/item/2004650652/](https://www.loc.gov/item/2004650652/)

+ Non-rhotic
+ Vowel qualities sound different

## Ways to infer pronunciation

+ Sound recordings (nope too old)
+ Look at historical reconstructions of dialects (couldn't find any)
+ Internal evidence and structure within author's own body of work
+ External evidence from other poets

## Internal Evidence

We slowly drove – He knew no haste\
And I had put **away**\
My labor and my leisure too,\
For His **Civility** (Because I Could Not Stop For Death - 479)

## Internal Evidence

Since then – 'tis Centuries – and yet\
Feels shorter than the **Day**\
I first surmised the Horses' Heads\
Were toward **Eternity** (Because I Could Not Stop For Death - 479)

## Internal Evidence

Before I got my eye put out –\
I liked as well to **see**\
As other creatures, that have eyes –\
And know no other **way** (Before I got my eye put out – 336)

## Other poets

+ Predictable rhyme
+ Same time period
+ Same geographical region

## Henry Wadsworth Longfellow

## Conclusion

+ She probably still has some slant rhyme
+ Be cautious when you're separated by time and space
+ Language changes!
+ Demand a bit more verification of slant rhyme and sight rhyme
